# barbu-python

Python implementation of [Barbu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbu_(card_game)), a 4-player trick-taking card game.

Some of the game scores are different from the ones written on Wikipedia but it's still zero-sum overall.

The ambition of this project is to create an Artificial Intelligence for the game, based on MCTS / UCT in addition to various heuristics.
